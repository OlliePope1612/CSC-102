Save Drunkin Clam

Brief: The Drunken Clam has been rigged to blow by an anonymous villain (probably the giant chicken). Peter Griffin must follow a 3-phase procedure to stop the detonation. Each step involves different modules that test your logic, memory, and nerve — all while Cleveland screams in the background.
You are Peter Griffin. You are not qualified for this. Good luck.


M1 
Module Name: Giggity Digits
Device: Numeric keypad with five glowing buttons.
Instructions:
	•	Quagmire whispered a 5-digit code after winking. You must remember it (you won’t).
	•	Enter the correct code within 1 attempt.
	•	If you mess up, he yells “Giggity!” as the bomb explodes. Seriously.

Tip: The correct code was programmed randomly when the bomb was armed. Only those who set it know. Use deductive guessing if you’re insane.

M2
Module Name: Peter’s Colorblind Crisis
Device: 5 multicolored wires plugged into the bomb.
Instructions:
	•	One wire is safe to unplug.
	•	The others? They’re like Stewie’s diaper — explosive.
	•	Colors may include: orange, yellow, blue, green, purple (shuffled every time).

Tip: The correct wire is chosen randomly when the bomb arms. Unplug carefully — or guess and pray.

If you unplug the wrong one, Cleveland panics and the place goes boom.


M3
Module Name: Binary Boogaloo
Device: 4 toggle switches (each switch can be set to ON or OFF).
Instructions:
	•	Joe screams: “Set the switches to the correct binary pattern, or we’re toast!”
	•	Each switch can be either:
	•	1 = ON
	•	0 = OFF
	•	There is only one correct combination (random at start).

Tip: The pattern is something like 1011 — but different every time.
If you’re programming this bomb, you’ll know the pattern.
Otherwise, this is a memory/logic game or pure guessing.
