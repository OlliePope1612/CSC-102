Peter Griffin somehow gets a job on Quahog’s new “Volunteer Bomb Squad” — a squad with no training, no qualifications, and absolutely no common sense.

The city hires Peter after he wins a radio contest by answering "Math problem" correctly (after three guesses).

Mayor West (or some other insane city leader) declares there’s a “high risk of cartoonish bomb threats” around Quahog, so Peter is sent out to defuse bombs with an absurd “Bomb Defusal Kit”.

The first bomb Peter encounters is planted at the Drunken Clam — and he has 5 minutes to defuse it.
Meanwhile, Quagmire, Joe, and Cleveland are absolutely no help (Quagmire just keeps hitting on the bomb, Joe’s wheelchair dies, and Cleveland keeps yelling “No no no no NO!” the closer the timer gets to zero).

Peter fumbles through random wires, reading confusing instructions like:
	•	“Cut the blue wire. Unless it’s feeling sad. Then cut the yellow wire.”
	•	“If the timer has a 7 in it, stop and do a chicken dance.”

Every wrong move Peter makes causes a ridiculous side effect — like unleashing a swarm of bees, setting off fireworks, or playing “Who Let the Dogs Out” at full volume.

Finally, Stewie and Brian show up at the last second. Stewie casually pulls out a laser gun, vaporizes the bomb in one shot, and says:

“Honestly, if humanity’s fate rested in his hands, we deserved extinction anyway.”

Peter still somehow claims credit for saving the day and gets awarded “Employee of the Month” at City Hall — before accidentally sitting on another bomb and starting the whole mess over again.
